## **Sports Gambling Simulator**

Project Overview:
- This application can be used as a sports gambling simulator, focusing on NBA basketball games. 
Users of this application can practice wagering on actual games and see their winnings or losses depending on 
how they chose to bet. 
- Those who seek a practice platform to test their wages in a risk free environment will find this application helpful. 
- As an avid basketball fan and an individual who likes to go against the odds, this project provides the ability
challenge myself by challenging conventional projects while bringing a passion project to life.
