## **Sports Gambling Simulator**

Project Overview:
- This application can be used as a sports gambling simulator, focusing on NBA basketball games. 
Users of this application can practice wagering on actual games and see their winnings or losses depending on 
how they chose to bet. 
- Those who seek a practice platform to test their wages in a risk free environment will find this application helpful. 
- As an avid basketball fan and an individual who likes to go against the odds, this project provides the ability
challenge myself by challenging conventional projects while bringing a passion project to life.

## **Instructions for Grader** 
How to generate the first two required events: 
- You can generate the first required event by first clicking on the "Account" button. This will bring you to a scene 
where you can enter an positive integer amount into the text box and then click on the "Add Amount" button. This will
add the specified amount into the account, open a confirmation box and bring you back to the main menu. 
- You can generate the second required event by again "Account" button. Again, you enter an positive integer amount and 
then click on the "Withdrawal" button, this will subtract the amount as long as your balance is larger than the
specified amount, open a confirmation box and bring you back to the main menu.
- In the Account scene, there is a label that displays your current account balance, this balance is updated after every
"Add Amount" or "Withdrawal" button click. 
- You can locate the audio and visual components simply by starting the application. The visual component is located 
on the main screen. In addition, please turn on your volume to hear the audio component of the program, it will be 
activated once you start the application. 
- You can save the state of my application by clicking on the "Quit and Save" button on the mainscreen or 
by exiting the application via the "x" on the tab itself. Essentially no matter, how you close the application, 
the information will automatically save. 
- You can reload the state of my application simply by starting up the application again. There is no button 
 that loads the data in the actual application as Professor Felix Grund said that having the state of the application
 upon start is sufficient. Piazza post @1017.
